\title{Plot a list of x3ps}
\arguments{
\item{x3pList}{a list of x3p objects. If the x3p objects are named in the
list, then these names will be included in the title of their respective
plot}

\item{type}{dictates whether one plot faceted by surface matrix or a list of
plots per surface matrix is returned. The faceted plot will have a
consistent height scale across all surface matrices.}

\item{rotate}{angle (in degrees) to rotate all surface matrices plotted}

\item{legend.quantiles}{vector of quantiles to be shown as tick marks on
legend plot}

\item{height.colors}{vector of colors to be passed to scale_fill_gradientn
that dictates the height value colorscale}

\item{na.value}{color to be used for NA values (passed to
scale_fill_gradientn)}

\item{guide}{internal usage}
}
\description{
Plots the surface matrices in a list of x3p objects. Either
creates one plot faceted by surface matrix or creates individual plots per
surface matrix and returns them in a list.

\examples{
\dontrun{
 x3pListPlot(list("name1" = referenceScan, "name2" = targetScan))
}
