\alias{decision_highCMC_identifyHighCMCThetas}
\title{Classify theta values in CMC-theta distribution as having "High" or "Low" CMC
candidate counts}
\usage{
decision_highCMC_identifyHighCMCThetas(cmcThetaDistrib, tau = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{cmcThetaDistrib}{output of the decision_highCMC_cmcThetaDistrib
function}

\item{tau}{constant used to define a "high" CMC count. This number is
subtracted from the maximum CMC count achieved in the CMC-theta
distribution. Theta values with CMC counts above this value are considered
to have "high" CMC counts.}
}
\description{
Classify theta values in CMC-theta distribution as having "High" or "Low" CMC
candidate counts
}
\note{
This function is a helper internally called in the decision_CMC
function. It is exported to be used as a diagnostic tool for the High CMC
method
}
