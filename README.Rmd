The cmcR package provides an open-source implementation of the Congruent Matching Cells method for cartridge case identification as proposed by [Song (2013)](https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=911193) as well as an "improved" version of the method proposed by [Tong et al. (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730689/pdf/jres.120.008.pdf).
