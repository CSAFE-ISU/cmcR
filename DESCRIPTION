Description: An open-source implementation of the 'Congruent Matching Cells' 
    method for cartridge case identification as proposed by Song (2013) <https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=911193> as well 
    as an extension of the method proposed by Tong et al. (2015) <doi:10.6028> (10.6028/jres.120.008).
    Provides a wide range of pre, inter, and post-processing options when
    working with cartridge case scan data and their associated comparisons. See
    the cmcR package website for more details and examples.
